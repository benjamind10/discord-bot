SpongeBob, will you forget stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... the ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!

Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser.
Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
Wh-what did you say?
I said, you're a--
How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!
Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day.

‚ô™F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, sharing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!‚ô™
And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...
Sounds like fun.
Well, the really fun part was when we...

You can't rush these things, you know.
You're forgetting the mission!
What are you talking about?

Heave-ho! If you drop one single slice of me booty, I'll have... your booty!

Here's your order, sir.

You've seen this before?
Eleven times as matter of fact. a
Yes, hello, doctor? Hospital? It won't do any good? Eleven times? Oh, he's goner. How do we tell him? a
Don't tell him. That'll only make him feel worse. The way I see it, he's only got till sunset. Why ruin his last day on earth? The lad deserves to enjoy his final hours.

That's good one Squidward! Next... a Knock-knock jokes! Hey Squid, knock-knock.
Look out, everyone, friends reverse! in
Turn left, and... stop. See, that's what it would be like if you had me for a face.
I can't breathe.
Are you sure you should be poking it like that?
Who's doctor here? the The last thing on the list is...
Does it involve more dismemberment?
Watch the sunset with Squidward.

Sunsets always remind me of bowls of fruit. What do they make you think of, Squidward?
Explosions... I mean, erosion.
You know, if I were die right now in some sort of fiery explosion due to carelessness of a friend, well, that would just be okay. Wow, it feels like something just dropped into my lower intestine. the Hey, smells like cherry. Or maybe grape. Blueberry? to Here it is, the sunset! I always love to count it down. Five...

Um, okay, I'll try. Gary! You are gonna finish your dessert, and you are gonna like it! Now it's your turn!
That's not what I meant, you barnacle head!
Oh, good one.
No! You were supposed to explode into a million pieces!
Why would I do that?
Because the pie you ate was a bomb!
The one that I left sitting on the counter this morning that I bought from pirates for 25 bucks and I didn't know it was a bomb, and you ate it... th... that pie!
Pie...pie... Oh, you mean this pie! I was saving it in my pocket for us to share. Let's eat! Oops!

Wouldn't that be top? the
Squid, wait! Wait!
A few inches later...
SpongeBob, how long are you gonna stay in your little fantasy world?
No, look, a ship! giant
Great! Let's go! Now I can finally give this anchor-dropper a piece of my mind.
I don't know, Squidward. That ship has a spooky green glow around it.
That's probably because its good-for-nothing owner is too lazy to clean or drop its anchors in the right place.
All right, who owns this crate? Come on out! I wanna file a complaint!
Doesn't this place seem familiar?
I don't know. Why?
I don't know. Doesn't it just kind of ring a bell?
I know who owns this boat but I just can't place name. the
No, no, it's not "rawr!"
I am the Flying Dutchman!
That's it! Squidward, this ship belongs to the Red Baron!
Who be disturbin' the Flying Dutchman's own lair?
It's Squidward. He wants complain to you. to
I... no, I don't.
Well, what about all that stuff about him having a dirty ship and being lazy and all?
I never said that.
Insultin' a man's ship be worse than insultin' his mother!
No, no, wait, it was mother you said was dirty, not his ship. his
That was a close one!
That was a closer one!
Hey! How come when they act up, all they get is welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's... the
So, are you gonna try that again?
How 'bout now?
No, no, they're not. Whew.
Now listen. Whosoever sets foot on the Flying Dutchman's ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of ghostly crew forever! And, uhh ever. his
Will we be getting business cards?
Silence! You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and frighten people. It'll be grueling, mind-numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.
Now you listen here, mister. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was good idea... Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me... Oh, gee, that's very nice. What is this, some kind magic act? of a
Would anyone else like to enter the "Fly of Despair"?
No! We know our place now, Mr. Dutchman.
We'll do anything you say!
Then, for starters, you can... swab the deck!
Look, Patrick! A real, live, ghost mop!
And I got this hat!
Listen! We're heading down to Bikini Bottom tonight for a little haunting spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!
You mean you want it to look good... and scary. Well, I think we can probably...
No, no, I think he means he wants it to look so good that it's scary.
Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!
I don't get it.
Look, it's easy, it simply means that...
Never mind what it means! I just want it to look scary! That's it! You know, mold growing on the ceilings and bugs in the sink.
So, you don't want it to look good?
A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!
What night be this! Crew, howl with me so that we might set the Seven Seas ablaze with fear! a
Leedle-leedle-leedle-lee! Leedle-eedle-eedle- eedle-eedle! Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle! Leedle-eedle-eedle-eedle-eedle!

Was that the signal? Okay, sorry, sorry, just... just do it again.
With the haunting memory of my ghostly ghost pirates!
How does he do that?
Get back on the ship.

Those guys are dorks.
Yes, but they're my dorks.
You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. Why do you think the Dutchman asked us to wait in our bunk room?
Maybe he's gonna give us a reward!
Like movie passes?
Or an oversized coffee mug?!
I've been thinking. Stop bouncing! This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.
You're setting us free?
Well, actually, I'm just gonna eat you. See you at dinner!
Wait, I have an idea!
